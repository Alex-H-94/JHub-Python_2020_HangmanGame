This is a passing entry for the MOD's JHUB Coding Scheme for Python (2020)

Theme: Hangman Game
Review:
- In future I would use more meaningful variable names in non-trivial lambdas - such as "updateGallows" - to clearer demonstrate what they are doing. 
- Consider wrapping the code in a main hangman.py file that is not part of a function into a __main__ function or similar.
- Clean the variables to return a new (updated) variable rather than updating the one passed in - such as "wordObscured".
